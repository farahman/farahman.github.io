<h2>How to install JDK?</h2>
<h2>Step 1:</h2>
<p>you need to install JDK since this is the compiler that will convert JAVA programs in machine language so your computer/machine can&nbsp;understand them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>JDK</strong>:&nbsp;The Java Development Kit (<em>JDK</em>) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.&nbsp;I would recommend you installing JDK version 8 (not 9 or anything less than 8) from the

<p><strong>For Windows users, READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY:</strong></p>
<p>If you have a Mac or a Linux machine, the command prompt/terminal already comes ready to be used. However, if you use a windows machine, please continue reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you don't have multiple version of JDK in your machine using the following command in the terminal:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; java -version</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This command lists all the java version installed in your machine.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there are multiple versions of JDK installed in your windows computer, you might encounter difficulty compiling and executing your program. In that case, you might need to set your&nbsp;<strong>JAVA_HOME</strong>&nbsp;<em>environment variable</em>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<strong>newest JDK</strong>&nbsp;so the IDE knows which version of JDK to use.</li>
<li>
<p>The following video will give you some idea on how to set the java_home environment variable:&nbsp;<a class="inline_disabled external" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6LT5lgOj0Y" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo1U_lGf1qo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo1U_lGf1qo  </a></p>
</li>
<li>Keep in mind that if you have a windows machine, without setting up the&nbsp;<strong>JAVA_HOME</strong> environment variable, you might NOT be able to use your command prompt terminal to compile and execute Java programs.</li>
