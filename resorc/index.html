            <p> The EECS department of Syracuse University  is proud to partner with <b>Google Research</b> to launch an undergraduate student engagement  program, <b>RESORC (Research Exposure in SOcially Relevant Computing).</b></p>
            <p>We encourage students from historically-underrepresented groups within computer science to apply, which includes, but is not limited to, women, students of color, first-generation college students, and LGBTQ+ students. No prior research experience required! Our goal is to expose students to what socially relevant computing research can look like, to help them build self-efficacy and practical research skills, to help them become stronger candidates for doctoral programs and to influence the career ambitions and choices of URM students in computing research by providing a supportive community of peers.</p>

<p><b>What experience needed:</b> Prospective students should have completed at least ECS 102 course. It is better if the students have completed the introductory computer science course sequence till CIS 351 .No prior research experience necessary!</p>
            <p><b>What will the program offer:</b>
            <li><b>Workshop1:</b>  A 2-day virtual workshop on information dissemination and team-building. This workshop will focus on information dissemination, collaborative team building, and speed-mentoring to identify challenges of the team project</li>
            <li><b>Workshop2:</b>  A 2-day virtual workshop on intorduction to research methodologies in computing and collaborative problem-solving and virtual research pitch presentation in teams.</li>
            <li><b>Research opportunity:</b>  More than 20 hour of paid hands-on research experience with a graduate mentor and faculty mentor academic mentor </li>
            <li><b>Networking:</b> Attend and observe EECS Undergraduate Research Symposium and  meet, coonect and network with faculty and industry researchers and graduate students who are amazing role models to learn from.</li>
            </p>

            <p><b>How much time commitment:</b> You will need to dedicate 2 days in March 2021 and 2 days in May 2021 to attend the virtual workshops.</p>
            <p><b>Any stipent:</b> We recognize that participating in this program takes time. To help offset this opportunity cost, each participant will receive a $300 stipend.</p>

            <li>Train the next generation of scholars to conduct cross-cutting computing research</li>
            <li>Provide research experience to undergraduate students from populations that are under-represented in computing by exposing them to culture of a research.</li>
            <li>Increase studentsâ€™ understanding of computing research methodologies.</li>
            <li>Introduce students to graduate education and research career opportunities through preparatory workshops and one-on-one mentoring.</li>
            <li>Provide students with multiple points of support from a diverse group of peers and faculty mentors.</li>
<!-- 2. Establish a mentorship program for undergraduate women that will help them learn about graduate life, research life, funding opportunities in grad school, professional career paths in academia and industry.
3. Engage female graduate students as mentor for the program which will help them develop mentorship/teaching skills for professional life.
4. This program also aims in bringing successful women leaders from different universities, federal research labs and industries who can talk about their experiences, motivation to inspire our students to build a strong career in computing research.

            <!--
            I am an undergraduate student in my first/second/third/fourth year [pick as appropriate]. Am I eligible to apply?
Yes!
I am an undergraduate student in my final year; I will graduate in 2021. Am I eligible to apply?
Yep!
I am an undergraduate SU student from [your location; any country, anywhere]. Am I eligible to apply?
Please do! Except, please note that SU is on EDT US time and many of our synchronous events will be in those working hours.
I am an undergraduate student from [any university or college institution, anywhere]. Am I eligible to apply?
Affirmative.
Is this program only for SU undergraduate students?
Yes, mostly; however if you are within the CNY area you can apply too; )
Is this program only for underrepresented groups or [x] students?
The goal of the exploreCSR program is to support students from underrepresented groups to pursue graduate studies and research careers in computing (here). We will consider all applicants, but our focus is on this goal.
I am a masters or PhD student. Am I eligible to apply?
We're afraid not, no.
I'm a high school student. Am I eligible to apply?
Again, we're afraid not, no.
I am on a gap year but will be starting soon/returning soon. Am I eligible to apply?
