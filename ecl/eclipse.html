<h2 >How to install Eclipse</h2>
<div class="section">
    <h2 id="installing-java">Step 0: Installing Java</h2>

    <p>Before you start installing Eclipse, make sure that you have the Java Development
    Kit (the JDK) installed on your system. If you're not sure, it's safe to just try
    installing it again. (If you already have the JDK installed, installing it again will
    just update you to a slightly newer version.)</p>

    <p>To download the JDK, go to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html" target="_blank">this page</a> and download the appropriate file for your
    operating system.</a>

    <p>Note: while the latest version of Java is Java 9, we strongly recommend you use
    Java 8 in this class. While our course projects in theory work with Java 9, they have
    only been tested with Java 8. The link above will take you to the Java 8 download page.</p>

    <h3>Step 1a: Download</h3>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> if you used Eclipse before, you may have an
    older version installed. If so, we strongly recommend you uninstall it
    and install the latest version for maximum compatibility.</p>

    <p>You can download Eclipse at <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads" target="_blank">eclipse.org/downloads</a>. The latest version, as of time of writing, is Eclipse SimRel.</p>

    <h3>Step 1b: Installation</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><p>Run the Eclipse installer. You should see a window like the one below;
            Select the first "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" option.</p>

            <p><img src="eclipse-ide-choice.png" /></p>
        </li>
        <li><p>After that point, you can keep hitting "yes" and select all the default
            options (unless you want to change something).</p>

            <p>You should eventually see a screen like this. Click the "Launch" button.</p>

            <p><img src="eclipse-install-done.png" /></p>


        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 1c: Configuration</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><p>When you run Eclipse, it'll ask you where you want your <em>workspace</em>
            to be (see screenshot below for example). Your workspace will be the location
            where Eclipse will add any new projects you create. You can change the location
            of the workspace if you want: just make sure you remember what you picked.</p>

            <p><img src="eclipse-workspace-select.png" /></p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Once you're done, you should see a "Welcome" screen like below. Close the
            "welcome" tab to open the regular editor.</p>

            <p><img src="eclipse-welcome.png" /></p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Next, select "Windows &gt; Preferences" (PC) or "Eclipse &gt; Preferences" (Mac) in the menu. Then, select
            "Java &gt; Installed JREs":</p>

            <p><img src="eclipse-set-jre.png" /></p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Click the "Search" button and select the "Java" folder. This
            folder should contain your installed JRE and JDK. (If it contains only
            the installed JDK, that's also ok). You can probably
            find this folder located at:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Windows: <code>C:\Program Files\Java</code></li>
                <li>Mac: <code>/Library/Java</code></li>
            </ul>

            <p>For example, on Windows:</p>

            <p><img src="eclipse-java-select.png" /></p>
        </li>
        <li><p>After hitting "ok", you should see a screen with a line for either
            both the JRE and the JDK, or just the JDK. Select the line for the JDK:</p>

            <p><img src="eclipse-select-jdk.png" /></p>
        </li>

        <li><p>Click the "Apply and close" button.</p></li>

        <li><p>Eclipse, by default, contains a fair degree of clutter. If you want
            to minimize the clutter, feel free to close the "Task List" and
            "Outline" tabs/views to the right.</p></li>
    </ol>
