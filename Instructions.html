<h2><a name="late">Missed exams, late submissions and revising grades</a></h2>
<ol>
  <li>If you are unable to take an exam at the scheduled time because of illness or other problems, you must contact me beforehand to arrange to take the exam at a different time. Failure to make prior arrangements for a missed exam will result in a grade of 0 for the exam.
  </li>
</br>
<!--<li>It will not be possible to receive credit for in-class work that is missed due to absence. In recognition of the fact that absences are occasionally unavoidable, I will drop the two lowest scores in this category when calculating your final grade.</li>
</br>-->
<!-- <li>For lab, we don't accept late submissions. <br/>Except under extraordinary circumstances, I will not provide extensions for illnesses, extracurricular obligations, etc. However, honoring the fact that you might have unexpecected circumstances in life, you will be provided with  <strong> three "LATE DAYS"</strong> which may be applied to any homework assignment. The use of <b>one late day</b> allows you to extend the deadline for an assignment by 24 hours. You may apply all three days to a single assignment or distribute them across multiple assignments. <br/> If you wish to use a LATE DAY for a Homework, you have to inform the TA the following - 1) which homework, and 2) how many days.
</li> -->

<li>For full credit, completed homework must be submitted by the posted deadline. Homework sub- mitted within 24 hours of the deadline will be subject to only 5% penalty. Homework submitted within 48 hours of the deadline will be subject to a 25% penalty. Homework submitted within 72 hours of the deadline will be subject to a 50% penalty. No credit will be given for Homework submitted more than 72 hours late. t is understandable that you may face many unexpected situations during the semester due to Covid-19 Pandemic. Hence, you will have eight "LATE DAYS", which may be applied to ONLY homework submissions. The use of a late day allows you to extend the deadline for a homework by 24 hours. You may apply multiple days to a single homework or allocate them to different homeworks. To use a late day you must inform the TA so he/she can keep a count.</li>

</br>
<li>

Online lab session on Wednesday will either be used to introduce a lab assignment, to demonstrate some new skills or to serve as a help session. Labs submitted within 24 hour of the deadline will not be subject to any penalty. Labs are mandatory, however, in recognition of the fact that you may have unavoidable absences, I will drop few grades in this category at the end of the semester.
</li>
</br>

<li>Requests to reassess/revise the grade for any work submitted must be made within one week from the day the grade is posted.</li>
</br>

<li>In this course, to recieve gardes, you need to submit the <a href="https://farahman.github.io/AI-CIS351-Pledge.pdf">Academic Integrity Pldege within 2 week of the semester.</li>

    your files.

  <!-- <li> Make sure everyone who worked on the assignment has their name in each of the java files. -->
    <br>
    (See <a href="#groups">Working in Groups</a> below.)
  <li> Zip your cover sheet and Java sources (No <code>.class</code>files please.)

<!--

<ul>
  <li>
       Typically, labs will be due on Fridays and homeworks on Tuesdays.
       <br><br>
  <li>
       The &ldquo;deliverable&rdquo; of the assigment is to be <b>on paper</b>
       and either <b>stapled</b> or <b>binder clipped</b> firmly
       together.
       <br><br>
  <li>
       Each Java file should have the following, filled-in
       comment at its beginning:
       <pre>
/**
 **  Assignment:
 **  Authors:
 **/</pre>
       After <b><code>Assignment:</code></b> put
       the name of the assignment, e.g.,
       <b><code>Homework 6</code></b> or
       <b><code>Lab 3</code></b>, or what have you.
       <br>
       After <b><code>Authors:</code></b>
       put the names of the authors of this assignment.
       <br>
       We <em class=red>will</em>
       take off points if you are missing this comment.
       <br>
       <br>
  <li>
       These should be placed in &ldquo;the box&rdquo; in SciTech 3-212.
       <br><br>
  <li>
       The files for the assignment should also be sent to the
       official archive.  To do this, just send a email message to
       <script>showemail2('ecs.syr.edu','royer')</script>
       with a subject line of just <b>351submission</b> (no spaces)
       and add the files as attachments.  If your mailer doesn't
       do attachments, then just include all the files in your
       message with clear separations between them and with
       indications of the names of the files.
       <p>
	<b>NOTE:</b> Do <em class=red>not</em> send any
	<code>.class</code> files or the instructor will be
	very grumpy.
       <br>
  <li>
       There should be only <b>one</b> assignment and archive copy
       submitted from each group.
       <blockquote>
         <b>However</b>, if you hand in an assignment early and
         later realize that you forgot something, or did something wrong,

<h2 align=center><a name="submit">
      Setting up and using the
      351submit script
</a></h2>

<h3>Set up</h3>

To set things up to use the
<a href="http://www.cis.syr.edu/courses/cis351/scripts/351submit">
351submit</a> script do the following:
<ol>
  <li>
       Add the following line to the bottom of your .cshrc file
       <pre class=dgreen>
       alias   351submit   /home/www/htdoc/courses/cis351/scripts/351submit
       </pre>
  <li>
       Type to Unix:
       <pre class=dgreen>
       source ~/.cshrc
       </pre>
</ol>
Once you have done this (correctly), you do not have to do it again.

</pre>
<h3>Use</h3>

Once you have done the set up,
to use the 351submit script to submit a homework (say homework number 4)
do the following.
<ol>
  <li>
       Type to Unix:
       <pre class=dgreen>
       351submit -h4
       </pre>
  <li>
       Follow the directions.
</ol>
Whereas, to submit a lab (say, lab number 6) do:
<ol>
  <li>
       Type to Unix:
       <pre class=dgreen>
       351submit -l6
       </pre>
  <li>
       Follow the directions.
</ol>
Remember 351submit is only a humble shell script, so
it is very fragile.

<h3>Shortcuts</h3>

There are some short cuts available in using this thing.  The general
form of the 351submit command is:
<font color=maroon>
<pre class=dgreen>
   351submit  [options] [files]

   options == -h&lt;num>, Mark as HW&lt;num>

              -l&lt;num>, mark as LAB&lt;num>
</pre>
</font>
So for example, to submit the files
<pre class=dgreen>
   Foo.java
   Wizbang.java
   hw4.output
   hw4.input
</pre>
for homework number 4, you may type to Unix:
<pre class=dgreen>
       351submit -h4 Foo.java Wizbang.java hw4.output hw4.input
</pre>
You will still be prompted for the names of the people in the
group submitting the assignment, but that is all.

<h2><a name="help">
      How to ask questions in Piazza
</a></h2>

  <ul>
  <li>
    <p>You should only use Piazza for generic questions and answers. It is appropriate to ask/answer questions about things that were discussed in lecture or things you read. It is even appropriate to ask/answer clarification questions about programming assignment. </p>
  <li><p>However, it is not appropriate to ask questions about source code that you have written for a programming assignment or for an answer to a question to include source code written for an assignment. </p>
    <li><p>
    Also, it is inappropriate to ask questions or give answers that might unduly help another student complete a programming assignment.</p>

  <li><p>If you are not sure whether a question/answer is appropriate, use email to ask the instructor before posting it.</p>

  <strong>Process:</strong> Before using Piazza, try to find the answer on your own. Then, and only then, you should use Piazza as follows. Piazza should be used as follows.

  <ul>
  <li>Check to see if your question has already been answered. (It’s annoying to ask questions that have already been answered and embarrassing for the answer to be let me Google that for you.)
  Draft your question. (In your question you should describe what you know about the answer. For example, “I know the problem isn’t X because I’ve already tried Y.”</li>
  <li>Proofread your question.
  Post your question.</li>
  <li>Remember not to post new questions in the discussion of an existing question because it will only be noticed by people who happen to be following the discussion.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<!--

Remember that you need to submit test runs of your homeworks and
labs together with the source code.


Here are two options for
capturing test runs.
<ol>
  <li> Use cut and paste from your terminal window into an emacs buffer
       which you can save and print.
       <br> <br>
  <li> Use the <i>script</i> program.  To use the script program:
       <ol type=a>
	 <li>
	      Type to Unix:
	      <pre class=dgreen>
    script</pre>
	      You will then get the message
	      <pre class=dgreen>
    Script started, file is typescript </pre>
	 <li>
	      At that point, <i>everything</i> you do in that terminal window
	      will be copied to the file typescript.
	 <li>
	      When you want to close off this copying, type to Unix (at the
	      beginning of a line)
	      <pre class=dgreen>
    exit	      </pre>
	      You will then get the message
	      <pre class=dgreen>
    Script done, file is typescript	      </pre>
	 <li>
	      You may then print the file <code>typescript</code>.

<h2><a name="why">
      Why programming assignments are important
</a></h2>
<blockquote>

  Programming assignments are primarily an instructional mechanism, not an assessment mechanism. Nonetheless, programming assignments will be graded and, in fact, will be graded strictly. There are two reasons for this. First, the grades will provide you with an assessment of how well you know the material. Second, experience has shown that students do not always make decisions that are in their own best interest, and often do not complete ungraded assignments :)
<p>
In other words, in this course, programming assignments are designed to: (1) help you learn the materials; (2) help you understand what you have and have not learned; and (3) encourage you to do the work that is necessary for learning to occur. Unambiguously, the best way for you to achieve the second objective is for you to complete programming assignments entirely on your own, occasionally asking questions of a general nature (i.e., about the topics you need to understand in order to complete assignment but not specifics about the assignment itself).
<p>
Hence, you may discuss programming assignments with other students who are currently enrolled in  your class, but you should limit the amount of collaboration and you should keep a careful record of it (so that you can assess yourself). You must not discuss the programming assignments with students who are not currently enrolled in your course, except for the designated TAs or lab assistants. You also must not discuss programming assignments with tutors of any kind – paid or volunteer, local or remote. Finally, you must not submit (even before the due date/time) another student’s work as your own. In other words, the code you submit must be written/typed entirely by you and you alone. Failure to comply with these policies is a violation of the SU Honor Code.
<p>
Though you are entitled to discuss the programming assignments with other people, you must be courteous. Most importantly, students are not required, or even encouraged, to provide assistance. So, if asked, you should feel free to decline such a request and, if asking, you must not take offense if such a request is denied. In addition, neither the instructor(s) nor lab assistant(s) may provide as much assistance as you want. Most frequently, this happens when they think the assistance you have requested will prevent you from learning an important concept. Again, you must not take offense if a request is denied.

<p>
  A. Students are to work on their HW without consulting with anyone that is not explicitly approved by the instructor. You can always ask for help from TA, grader and the instructor.
B. Students are allowed to discuss the meaning of HW programs or problems together but are expected to work totally independent of anyone that is not explicitly approved by the instructor when working on the solutions to a program or problem and when doing their coding.
C. In some cases, the instructor may distribute a written policy (possibly as a part of their syllabus) that specifies how much cooperation and joint work is permitted on their HW.
<p>
Policy A is the default policy that will be used unless the instructor specifies otherwise in writing (e.g., in their syllabus or in assignment instructions) indicating that one of the other policies will be followed. Violation of this policy will result in reporting for academic integrity violations. Students are to clarify with their instructors any questions they may have about how much cooperation and joint work is permitted on HW.

<h2><a name="what">
What we look for in programming assigments
</a></h2>

<blockquote>

Writing a program is in many ways just like any other piece of
writing: you want to be clear and to the point, you want the general
organization to reflect your intent, and you want to have particular
audiences in mind for a particular piece of writing.

<p>

The programs written for this course will have two distinct audiences.

<p>

The first will be made up of the Java compiler (<tt>javac</tt>)
and the Java interpreter (<tt>java</tt>).  These guys are picky on
small matters of syntax and semantics, but beyond that they don't
care what nonsense you shove at them.

<p>

The second audience for your work will be the person grading it.
The grader will typically have a huge stack of assignments to wade
through.  When he or she picks up another one of these
assignments, she wants to quickly ascertain certain things.
<p>
  Additionally, sometimes, we will use JUnit test classes to asses the correctness of your program. Hence, it is very important that you read the instructions of homework handout very careful and do everything as excatly required by the handout, so your program does not disqualify when it is auto-graded by a script.
  <p>
    Finally, for submitted programs (including labs and homeworks), you need to write your name in the class documentation section of the Java class that you will be writing. If you DO NOT include your name at the top of the java file, <b>2-5 points will be deducted.</b>
<dl>
  <dt>
       <b>Administrative details</b>
  <dd>
       Who is this assignment from and what course-section are they in?  <br>
       If this is a multi-part assignment,
       is it clear what part of the document at hand
       handles the particular parts of the assignment?
       <br><br>
  <dt>
       <b>Program comments</b>
  <dd>
       Are there enough comments and documentation (including preconditions,
       postconditions, return-conditions, ...)
       so that it is clear what each part of the program is
       intended to do?
       Is there a general write up for the assignment?
       <br><br>
  <dt>
       <b>Program formatting</b>
  <dd>
       Is the code formatted in a way that makes it
       easy to read and figure out what is going on? <br>
       <i>(See the Styleguide for better understanding. Also, various IDEs will handle this for you.)</i>
       <br><br>
  <dt>
       <b>Testing and correctness</b>
  <dd>
       If the assignment asks for specific tests,
       were they done and did they give correct results? <br>
       Is the code correct and fully exercised?
      <br>
       If part of the program is not working,
       is there a note on this in the assignment? <br>
       <blockquote>
          If there is no such note, then the grader may assume that
          you didn't realize something was wrong or are trying to hide
          the problem.
       </blockquote>
  <dt>
       <b>Quality</b>
  <dd>
       Beyond correctness, is the solution particularly nice or
       particularly dreadful? <br>
       How good is the general presentation?
       <br><br>

  <dt>
       <b>Relevancy</b>
  <dd>
       Does the submission include irrelevant junk?<br>
       <blockquote>
       <b>Example.</b> An assignment asks you to modify a particular class
       and this class makes use of 16 other classes which do not get
       modified.  If you hand in the source code for the
       modified class <i>and</i> the source code for the 16
       unmodified classes, then the latter is irrelevant junk
       and you will be marked off for including it.
       </blockquote>
</dl>
In general, the above are what <i>anyone</i> looking at another person's
code would want to see.

<p>
Your grade on a particular assignment will be based on:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
80% &ndash; correctness, clarity, and quality of the solution
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
20% &ndash; documentation, write up, and general presentation

  <b>Academic Integrity</b>
  <p>
  Syracuse University's academic integrity policy reflects the high value that we, as a university community, place on honesty in academic work. The pilot policy in effect at the College of Engineering and Computer Science defines our expectations for academic honesty and holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. Students should understand that it is their responsibility to learn about course-specific expectations, as well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The pilot policy governs appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of participation in class activities. The pilot policy also prohibits students from submitting the same work in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance from both instructors. Under the pilot policy, students found in violation are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered. SU students are required to read an online summary of the university's academic integrity expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during pre-term check-in on MySlice. For more information and the pilot policy, see:
  <a href = "https://policies.syr.edu/policies/academic-rules-student-responsibilities-and-services/academic-integrity-policy/">academic integrity</a>
 <p>
  The expectations for this course are the same as those given in the pilot policy: you should (1) credit your sources, (2) do your own work, (3) communicate honestly, and (4) support academic integrity.
<p>

  The pilot policy Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric establishes recommended guidelines for the determination of grade penalties by faculty and instructors, while also giving them discretion to select the grade penalty they believe most suitable, including course failure, regardless of violation level. Any established violation of the pilot policy in this course will result in a failing grade for the course.
